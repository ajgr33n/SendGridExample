SendGridExample
===============

The Windows Azure site hosing this is adamgreen.azurewebsites.net, sendgrid.losslessdesign.com is just a friendly URL.

The eform.html file hosts the webform and contains a small script at the bottom to POST the form contents to the email_engine.html file. It is then submitted to SendGrid to generate the emails using the default PHP API library files and syntax.
